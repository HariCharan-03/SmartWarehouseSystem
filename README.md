# 🏭 Smart Warehouse System
### Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) Mini Project

A **Smart Warehouse Management System** that demonstrates the practical application of **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)** concepts using **Fractional Knapsack** and **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Modern warehouses need to:
- Store products optimally based on capacity
- Maximize value under limited space
- Quickly locate products using the shortest path

This project visually simulates optimal product placement and shortest path navigation inside warehouses.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Apply **Fractional Knapsack Algorithm** for optimal space utilization
- Apply **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** for shortest path navigation
- Visually demonstrate algorithm execution
- Help students understand DAA concepts through real-world simulation

---

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

### 1️⃣ Fractional Knapsack (Greedy Algorithm)

- Products are sorted based on **Value/Weight ratio**
- Supports **fractional placement** of products
- Maximizes total value under capacity constraints

**Time Complexity:**
- Sorting: `O(n log n)`
- Placement: `O(n)`

---

### 2️⃣ Dijkstra’s Algorithm (Shortest Path)

- Finds the shortest path from warehouse entrance to rack
- Warehouse is modeled as a **weighted graph**

**Time Complexity:**  
`O(V²)` (array-based implementation)
